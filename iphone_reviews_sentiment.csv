iPhone 14 Pro,"First of all, I would like to state that I ordered my phone on Wednesday night and I was told it will come on Saturday. It came the NEXT DAY on Thursday! Not to mention the phone worked perfectly and I was able to active my T-Mobile eSIM from my Samsung s24.The phone is in near perfect condition! I thought I was tripping when I saw how clean the phone looked and feel. And the battery health? 90% and it has last me the whole day so far! Even if it doesn’t for whatever reason, I already have a power bank so it’s no big deal.Just had to update to the latest software and buy a case and screen protector but the phone works great! 10/10!

iPhone 14 Pro,"I was very skeptical to order a refurbished phone on Amazon because I have never ordered outside of my mobile provider before and I saw NIGHTMARE reviews on Walmart’s website for refurbished phones of folks saying they ordered a phone just to find out it had been stolen. But I said okay Amazon is really good with returns god forbid it ends up being messed up or stolen. Nope! Super good quality phone and I got it 12 hours earlier than amazon said I would. Def a great option if you don’t need the absolute newest unused phone but need to upgrade. Got 1 TB IPhone 14 Pro in excellent condition and battery came at 85% capacity and it was unscathed and undamaged. Recommend.

iPhone 14 Pro,"I bought the acceptable one and the phone came with little to no scratches or dents a few scruffs on the edges and a prominent scratch on the middle top of the screen but it’s an upgrade from my XR so I don’t mind. The physical quality is good but the internal is where I’m like “yeah this is definitely ‘acceptable’ ” because the battery life was at 84% when I got it but I don’t mind since it’s a 1TB phone I will get the battery replaced. I also noticed the phone overheating a bit while transferring my data from my old phone i have felt it get warm a bit when downloading apps a bit concerning. But other than that it’s okay.

iPhone 14 Pro,"Phone came in a timely manner and came as described. The phone was good overall. Some small marks on the screen that are barely noticeable with a screen protector. I wish the battery was a little better. It’s at 87% and he guarantees at least 85%. I would’ve been completely happy if the battery was around 92 or 93%, but you get what you get.

iPhone 14 Pro,"Decent renewed phone. It was supposed to be excellent condition but did have a slight small scratch on corner and battery was exactly at 80%. Didnt feel like returning and dealing with finding another. Shipped and sold by Amazon but came in a non amazon packaging so not sure if it was amazon renewed or not compared to others i have purchased from amazon that come in their boxes.

iPhone 14 Pro,"I upgraded from my iPhone 11. Phone arrived in excellent condition with no scratches or cosmetic damage as described with a 5 Watt charging block and a USB A to lightning connector. All features work (FaceID, Cameras, ProMotion ect.), and battery health was better than expected at 88%. I recommend if you're looking at one listed in excellent condition, better price than used on most other sites.

iPhone 14 Pro Max,"I am a PC and Android guy and don't particularly care for Apple products...until now. My wife on the other hand has an Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and likes Apple products. This is my first Apple smartphone. This review is about the condition of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max that I purchased from this seller. I will not say much about the smartphone itself as there are many other reviews on it.The seller advertised the item as renewed and in excellent condition. I received the smartphone in 4 days which was a nice surprise because the original estimated delivery date was 7-10 days. The iPhone package came in a plain white box (not the original Apple box) and included a generic lightning to USB-A charging cable. Nothing else is included. FYI, Apple did not include a charger with the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Out of the box, I inspected the item very carefully and up close. It looked just like brand new. Looking from closer than 12 inches, there were no scratches, dents, or nicks anywhere. I did find two very small paint chips on one corner edge of the outer steel frame. One paint chip was about 1/16 inch in size and the other was even smaller than that. From 12 inches away, the paint chips are barely noticeable but I can see them. A cell phone case will cover them up anyway so it's not an issue for me.I fully charged up the iPhone and turned it on. It booted up right away and I went through the setup process and connected it to my wi-fi router. I called my service provider, T-Mobile, and provided the necessary information to transfer the service to my new phone. I had a slight hitch where I could not make phone calls. I found out that I had to click setup in the cellular setting. Once I did that, I was connected to my service provider. Phone calls then went through without a problem. Also, I was able to pair my generic earplugs via Bluetooth very easily and quick.The renewed iPhone shows the battery health maximum capacity to be at 92% relative to when it was new. That is very good. Daily, I have used many apps, checked emails, made phone calls/texting, taken photos/videos, etc., and found minimal battery drainage. I can probably go a few days without recharging.The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is bigger and heavier than my previous Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone so that is something you may consider if size and weight are an issue.All in all, I love the Apple iPhone Pro Max and I can say this is a good and honest seller.

iPhone 14 Pro Max,"I bought the phone in excellent condition. I’m a stickler for perfection, it had tiny light marks on the side . But the back and screen are perfect. My main complain Was when I opened the package the phone was sliding outside of the plastic baggy and the box was not fully closed. To pay this much for a used phone it needs to be packaged throughly. I’ve bought many phones off amazon for years so I know the standards . Overall the battery life is 86 percent which is good and it’s works great!

iPhone 14 Pro Max,"Phone looks brand new, battery is over 90%. Works perfectly. No visible scratches. I thought there was a scuff on the glass, but it turns out there was a glass screen protector on it. I thought the Pro Max would be wider, but it's really just taller, and much thicker and heavier than my iPhone 11.  Have not used the high res camera, but the optical zoom is great.

However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.PerformanceThe iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.CameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera.

iPhone 15,"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience
